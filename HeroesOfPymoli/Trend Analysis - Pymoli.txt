## Key Observations from generated dataframes in Pymoli Project :

1. According to the *GENDER DEMOGRAPHICS*  &  *PURCHASE ANALYSIS* (by gender)  dataframes, the number of Male players are very high at 84% of Total players and so are their purchases.

2. From *AGE DEMOGRAPHICS*  &  *PURCHASE ANALYSIS* (by Age), we do see a trend where the player purchases are very high between the age group 20-24 and very less number of purchases in the age group 40+.

3.  Most Popular Item itself is Most Profitable item.
